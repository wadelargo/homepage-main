      <div id="nicksInfo">
        <div id="left side">
          <p class="para">I am a web developer focusing on the MEAN stack with a love for TypeScript. Development is a
            passion of mine, which began with the FreeCodeCamp curriculum on 15 April 2020. In December of 2020 I
            accepted a position with freeCodeCamp, and have continued to learn, grow, and acquire new skills.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            In my free time I enjoy playing a video game or reading a book. I enjoy learning new skills and picking up
            random bits of trivia. For example, did you know that an "emordnilap" is a word which when reversed spells
            another word?
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            I am a firm believer in open-source. All of my project files are available on GitHub, and I am open to Pull
            Requests and suggestions on all of them. If you would like to contribute, you can access my GitHub profile
            on the "connect" page.</p>
